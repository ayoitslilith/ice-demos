# Ice Custom Error

The Custom error demo shows how to define an operation that throws a custom exception defined as
`GreeterException` when an issue is present.

You can build the client and server applications with:

``` shell
dotnet build
```

First start the Server program:

```shell
cd Server
dotnet run
```

In a separate terminal, start the Client program:

```shell
cd Client
dotnet run
```
