# Glacier2 Greeter

This demo shows how to write a client that calls an Ice object hosted in a server "behind" a Glacier 2 router:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    c[Client] --tcp--> g[Glacier2 router:4063] --tcp--> s[Server:4061<br>hosts Greeter]
```

Ice for Ruby supports only client-side applications. As a result, you first need to start the Glacier2 router and a
Greeter server implemented in a language with server-side support, such as Python, Java, or C#.

Then, in a separate window:

- Compile Greeter.ice with the Slice to Ruby compiler into Greeter.rb

```shell
slice2rb Greeter.ice
```

- Run the client application

```shell
ruby client.rb
```
